# wshell

A new type of shell powered by Effect-TS, focusing on type-safety and functional programming principles.

## wshell vs. Nushell

`wshell` takes inspiration from modern shells like `Nushell` but with a strong emphasis on the static typing and composability offered by the Effect-TS ecosystem.

| Feature                 | wshell (Anticipated)                                  | Nushell                                               |

| **Language Paradigm**   | Functional, Type-Safe                                 | Functional, with imperative features                  |
| **Type System**         | Strong, static typing via TypeScript & Effect-TS      | Gradually typed, strong type system at runtime        |
