| **Core Philosophy**         | Effect-TS, functional, config-driven orchestration                       | Simple CLI wrapper around npm scripts      | Simple concurrent process runner  | Script runner + caching                                  | Monorepo task orchestration + caching           | Monorepo platform + orchestration         |
| **Primary Scope**           | Script orchestration with dependencies, retries, timeouts                | Run scripts sequential/parallel            | Run commands concurrently         | Run scripts with dependency graph + caching              | Monorepo pipelines, caching, incremental builds | Monorepo pipelines, generators, caching   |
| **Type Safety**             | High (typed config + Effect composition)                                 | Low                                        | Low                               | Low                                                      | Medium (config, plugins)                        | Medium (config, plugins)                  |

| **Best Fit**                | Complex workflows where correctness, resiliency, and typed config matter | Small projects needing basic orchestration | Dev workflows (watchers, servers) | Medium projects wanting caching without monorepo tooling | Large monorepos focusing on build speed         | Large monorepos needing platform features |
